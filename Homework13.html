            Homework #13 yet again had a us creating a spore-like game using P5.js where we needed to interact with different shapes moving along
            the X and Y axis moving a charecter to get to the exit with a message saying you have won or escaped. We added the option to click
            with a circle forming as well as the charecter being able to be moved with the keyboard. This time we were using Arrays to create the 
            shapes while still ignoring all collisions.
