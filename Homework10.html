            Homework #10 again had us working with P5.js where we added some simple shapes and had them moving on the screen at different speeds
            along the X and Y axis. We also had our self-portrait get larger five times and then get smaller five times and repeat forever. We also 
            included a video of what we did with our work for the week.
